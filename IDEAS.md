# Test ideas

1. Simple google search (performs search and opens first non advert link and takes screenshot of loaded page)
2. Simple duckduckgo search (same as above)
3. Simple ecosia search (same as above)
4. Github code scraper (challenge): scrapes all code from public github repository (not sure is it good idea, but seems like nice challenge)
